# KReservationsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.16.

Simple project to make restaurant table reservations.

## How to run the app

- Download the app from the main branch
- Install on your computer node version 14.15.0 and angular cli version 12.2.16.
- Open the app go to C:\XXX\XXX\XXX\XXX\kReservations-app\kReservations-app>
- Run npm i
- on the same terminal run, npm start
- Open a second terminal at the same route and run npx json-server db.json
- Open browser and paste http://localhost:4200/#/reservation
- Have fun!!

- NOTE: I have set a calculated random number for the ID to insert it in the db.json it should be fine because there are a lot of number
  and it should not collide but just in case if there is some issue regarding the checking whether the user can create or not a reservation should be because of that.
